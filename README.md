# Computational Immunology Summer School 2025

## Welcome

Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoires (AIRRs) are central to the immune systemâ€™s ability to recognize and combat a wide array of pathogens. These receptors, expressed by T and B cells, arise through complex genetic recombination. Their study is essential for understanding immune diversity, identifying disease biomarkers, developing personalized immunotherapies, and designing effective vaccines.

This course is designed for participants with a basic understanding of R and command-line tools. It offers a comprehensive foundation in AIRR data analysis, blending theoretical concepts with hands-on training in computational tools and laboratory methods. The curriculum includes advanced techniques in secondary data analysis and exposure to real-world research applications.
